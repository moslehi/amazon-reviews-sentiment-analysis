# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
In this project, I worked on Amazon Reviews dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews) to build machine learning and natural language processing models to predict whether a review is positive or negative. 

The following picture shows the the implemented framework for processing text into numeric vecotrs.

Mathematica is used for the implementation; therefore, you will need Mathematica installed on your computer to be able to view the notebook. I tried different algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks, SVM, logistic regression and Markov models. In the following you can see the ROC curves for different algorithms.
